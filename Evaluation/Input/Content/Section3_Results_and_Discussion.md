The PBPK model for fluconazole was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* intravenous infusions and oral administrations (capsules).
* a dose range of 25 to 800 mg.

The model quantifies excretion via urine (glomerular filtration) and metabolism via UGT2B7.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-fluconazole-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-fluconazole-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
