Fluconazole is an antifungal medication for the treatment of a number of different fungal infections. It is metaboliszed by UGT2B7 and renally excreted by glomerular filtration. About 70% of fluconazole is excreted unchanged in urine during 120 hours.  Fluconazole is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and can therefore serve as a perpetrator for CYP3A4 in DDI studies. 

The herein presented PBPK model of fluconazole has been developed using published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Palkama et al. ([Palkama 1998](#5-References)), Ripa et al. ([Ripa 1993](#5-References)), Shiba et al. ([Shiba 1990](#5-References)), Ahonen et al. ([Ahonen 1997](#5-References)), Brammer et al. ([Brammer 1990](#5-References)), Brammer et al. ([Brammer 1991](#5-References)), Thorpe et al. ([Thorpe 1990](#5-References) and Varhe et al. ([Varhe 1996](#5-References)). 
The model has then been evaluated by comparing observed data to simulations of both intravenously and orally administered fluconazole covering a dose range of 25 mg to 400 mg. Both single dose and multiple dose administration are represented in the development and evaluation data sets. 

The presented model includes the following features:

- metabolism by UGT2B7,
- inhibition of CYP3A4,
- renal clearance by glomerular filtration,
- oral absorption with dissolution rate assigned to the Weibull function for low, medium and high doses.
